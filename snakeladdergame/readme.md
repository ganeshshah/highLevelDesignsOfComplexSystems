# Design snake ladder game

## Requirement gathering :
- Multiplayer
- Only considering human player
- Board can be of any varying size decided by user
- Position of snakes and ladders decided at initialization of the game randomly
- No of snakes and ladders are also random in nature
- The snakes and ladders are at valid position, i.e they do not conflict each other
- Size of snakes and ladders are also random
- In future different new entities might get introduced like : Kangaroo, Lizard
- A player enters the game at position only after they get a 1 or 6 when dice is thrown
- Can there be more than one dice. For now we are using only 1 dice. The max no. for a single dice should be configurable.
- The same player should roll the dice again if they get the highest number.
- Winner is someone who get's exactly 100 / max size of the board.
- For every game maintain leader board | Rankings for all player
